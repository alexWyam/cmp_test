TEST DEVELOPED BY ÁLEX CÁCERES.

##INSTALLATION
DECOMPRESS THE FILE .ZIP
OPEN THE FOLDER WITH NAME “DIST” AND START THE APP DOING DOBLE CLICK IN “INDICE.HTML” FILE

##ABOUT THE CONTENT
THE TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN A REAL ENVIROMENT. IT HAS MAMP SERVER, GRUNT TOOL TASK AND TWO ENVIRONMENTS:
DEVELOPMENT (SRC)
REAL (DIST)


##ABOUT THE TEST
TO MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT I HAVE USED HTML, CSS 3, SASS PREPROCESSOR AND JAVASCRIPT
I COULDN' T MAKE THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE  I HAD NEVER CREATED A CHAT AND I DON' T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD
THE APP HAS BEEN TESTED IN CHROME, FIREFOX, OPERA AND SAFARI BROWSERS FOR MOBILE DEVICES
THE INPUT TEXT FROM THE CHAT PAGE DOESN' T WORK; WHEN THE CHAT PAGE WAS ONLOAD THIS SHOWS A RANDOM MESSAGE BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ANSWER
ON THE “CHAT.HTML” FILE THERE IS A COMMENT CODE; IF UNCOMMENT YOU CAN SEE HOW A CONVERSATION WOULD REMAIN
